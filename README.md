# Shor-s_algorithm

#Introduction

Shor's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization, which can efficiently find the prime factors of a given integer . It is particularly significant because it demonstrates the potential of quantum computers to solve problems that are infeasible for classical computers, such as factoring large integers used in RSA encryption.

This document provides an overview of how to use Shor's Algorithm for factorization, including its prerequisites, implementation steps, and an example.

#Prerequisites

-Quantum Computing Environment:

You need access to a quantum computing framework, such as:

Qiskit (Python-based quantum SDK by IBM).

Cirq (Quantum SDK by Google).

Access to a real quantum computer (e.g., IBM Quantum or AWS Braket) or a quantum simulator.

-Basic Knowledge:

Familiarity with quantum mechanics and quantum circuits.

Understanding modular arithmetic and the concepts of periodicity in mathematics.

-System Requirements:

A computer with Python installed (for Qiskit or Cirq implementations).

Libraries: Python packages such as qiskit, numpy, and matplotlib.

#Steps to Implement Shor's Algorithm

-Choose a Composite Integer :

The algorithm works for  that is not prime.

-Classically Pick a Random Integer :

Choose  such that .

Ensure  is coprime to  (i.e., gcd(a, N) = 1). If not,  itself may be a factor of .

Quantum Step: Period Finding

Use quantum circuits to find the period  of the function . The period  is the smallest positive integer such that .

-Verify the Period :

Check if  is even. If  is odd, repeat steps 2 and 3 with a different .

Check if . If it is, repeat with a different .

-Compute Factors of :

-Use the period to calculate the factors.

-Output the Factors:

If successful, the factors of  are returned.

If the process fails, repeat with a new random .
